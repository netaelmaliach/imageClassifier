# imageClassifier

 The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data set using the unsupervised learning algorithm K-means.
 The images are black and white, containing 28 Ã—28 pixels. Most of the images contain
a lot of background, which makes the computations a bit redundant. To make those
computations more feasible on your computers, we will first apply a PCA dimensionality reduction to the data
